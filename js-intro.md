# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a piece of code that accepts data in the form of arguments/parameters and returns a value to the program. Functions can be called multiple times throughout a program and can accept different arguments/parameters each time they are called. You would use a function to perform a calculation or task.

#### 2. What is a method?
A method is an action that can be called on an object to provide information about or affect that object.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
.includes() will tell you if a letter is present in a string, .toUpperCase() capitalizes all of the letters in a string, .concat() joins two strings together

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Accessor methods don't change an array, but mutator methods do. If you want to preserve the original array you would want to use an accessor method. If you want to change the array you would use a mutator method.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log() outputs a value to the terminal, while return simply returns the value to the program without outputting anything to the terminal. Because you won't see a returned value, console.log() is useful for testing a program to make sure it's outputting the expected value. Return is useful for providing the program with a value to use without cluttering the terminal unnecessarily.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
What helped me learn the most was when Sarah came around and looked at our code and gave us a nudge in the right direction when we got stuck or helped us talk through potential solutions, even if they didn't end up working. By far my biggest struggle learning on my own is that when I get stuck I end up going down multiple rabbit holes on google, W3Schools, StackOverflow, etc. and banging my head against the wall trying every direction I can think of, and then being frozen when I don't know what else to try. Having someone to guide my thought process by confirming what might work and explaining what absolutely won't work and why has been extremely helpful in refining my problem-solving strategy.
